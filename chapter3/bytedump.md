The object dump you're looking at is part of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) bytecode, which is a form of machine code executed by the eBPF virtual machine in the Linux kernel.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bytecode Explanation**: `73 1a fe ff 00 00 00 00`

   - **73**: This is the opcode. In eBPF, the opcode `73` represents a store operation for an 8-bit (1 byte) value. Specifically, it corresponds to the instruction `STX_MEM(BPF_B, dst_reg, src_reg, offset)`, where `BPF_B` indicates the size of the value being stored (in this case, 8 bits or 1 byte).

   - **1a**: This is a combination of the destination and source registers. The first 4 bits (1) represent `dst_reg` (destination register) and the last 4 bits (a or 10 in decimal) represent `src_reg` (source register). In eBPF, registers are named `r0` to `r10`.

     - `dst_reg = 1` corresponds to `r1`.
     - `src_reg = 10` corresponds to `r10`.

   - **fe ff 00 00**: This represents the offset value. It's a 32-bit (4 bytes) signed integer in little-endian format. When converted, `fe ff` (first two bytes) represent -2 (in signed 16-bit format), and the next two bytes `00 00` are just padding in this case. So the offset is -2.

   - **00 00 00 00**: This is padding to ensure the instruction is 64 bits (8 bytes) long.

2. **Instruction**: `*(u8 *)(r10 - 2) = r1`

   This translates to:
   - `*(u8 *)`: Dereference a pointer to an 8-bit value.
   - `(r10 - 2)`: The memory address is calculated by taking the value of register `r10` and subtracting 2.
   - `= r1`: Store the value from register `r1` into the memory address calculated above.

So, the instruction `*(u8 *)(r10 - 2) = r1` means "store the least significant byte of the value in register `r1` at the memory address `r10 - 2`".

### Summary

The bytecode `73 1a fe ff 00 00 00 00` translates to the eBPF instruction `*(u8 *)(r10 - 2) = r1`, which means that the least significant byte of the value in register `r1` is stored in the memory location at `r10` minus 2 bytes.

## SECOND LINE
Let's break down the object dump `6b a1 fc ff 00 00 00 00` step by step.

1. **Bytecode Explanation**: `6b a1 fc ff 00 00 00 00`

   - **6b**: This is the opcode. In eBPF, the opcode `6b` represents a store operation for a 16-bit (2 bytes) value. Specifically, it corresponds to the instruction `STX_MEM(BPF_H, dst_reg, src_reg, offset)`, where `BPF_H` indicates the size of the value being stored (in this case, 16 bits or 2 bytes).

   - **a1**: This is a combination of the destination and source registers. The first 4 bits (a or 10 in decimal) represent `dst_reg` (destination register), and the last 4 bits (1) represent `src_reg` (source register).

     - `dst_reg = 10` corresponds to `r10`.
     - `src_reg = 1` corresponds to `r1`.

   - **fc ff 00 00**: This represents the offset value. It's a 32-bit (4 bytes) signed integer in little-endian format. When converted, `fc ff` (first two bytes) represent -4 (in signed 16-bit format), and the next two bytes `00 00` are just padding in this case. So the offset is -4.

   - **00 00 00 00**: This is padding to ensure the instruction is 64 bits (8 bytes) long.

2. **Instruction**: `*(u16 *)(r10 - 4) = r1`

   This translates to:
   - `*(u16 *)`: Dereference a pointer to a 16-bit value.
   - `(r10 - 4)`: The memory address is calculated by taking the value of register `r10` and subtracting 4.
   - `= r1`: Store the least significant 16 bits of the value from register `r1` into the memory address calculated above.

So, the instruction `*(u16 *)(r10 - 4) = r1` means "store the least significant 16 bits of the value in register `r1` at the memory address `r10 - 4`".

### Summary

The bytecode `6b a1 fc ff 00 00 00 00` translates to the eBPF instruction `*(u16 *)(r10 - 4) = r1`, which means that the least significant 16 bits of the value in register `r1` is stored in the memory location at `r10` minus 4 bytes.
